# MyReads

This React app tracks books I've read, am reading, or want to read. It was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses files from Udacity's [reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). It was the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.
